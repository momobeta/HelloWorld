Due to the nature of the assignment, I had to create 2 main methods in separate files
Since you normally can't run the project at once with 2 main methods, I renamed the "Main" in "Clock.cs" to "Mainn"
Please test "Branch.cs" first, rename its "Main" to anything else, then correct the name of the "Main" in "Clock.cs" to test it.
Thank you.
